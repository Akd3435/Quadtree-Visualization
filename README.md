This repository presents a visualization of the Quadtree data structure, showcasing how it subdivides a 2D space into smaller regions when the number of points in a given area exceeds the allowed capacity. The project provides an interactive and visual approach to understanding spatial partitioning and its applications.

<span style="font-size:42px;">Features</span>


Quadtree Construction – Dynamically build the quadtree by adding points on the canvas, and watch how the space is subdivided into quadrants.

Region Query Search – Perform efficient searches within a square area to instantly retrieve points contained inside it.

Collision Detection Visualization – Experience real-time collision detection, where the quadtree efficiently identifies overlapping or nearby points, demonstrating its usefulness in graphics and game development.

<span style="font-size:42px;">Tech Stack</span>
 

HTML – For structuring the canvas and layout.

CSS – For styling and making the visualization interactive and visually appealing.

JavaScript – For implementing the quadtree logic, handling point insertion, queries, and rendering the visualization in real time.
